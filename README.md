**CURRENT VERSION: [v1.2](https://github.com/acoastalfog/sinai-ventilator-components/blob/master/v1.2). Instructions in the current version's folder should be followed, together with the supplied protocol.**

**NOTE 2020-04-01: *We have split version tracking in this project into folders. Each version contains its own `README.md` file, together with the Mount Sinai protocol, STEP, STL, and Fusion360 component files, prototyping instructions, and walk-throughs.***

# Mount Sinai Health System Split Ventilator Prototyping
The Sinai BioDesign Group at the Mount Sinai Health System is supporting ongoing work by the Department of Anesthesia's team to develop a robust and validated protocol for ventilator splitting at the Mount Sinai Hospital System. Our support is mainly in the design and prototyping of components for the split ventilator system.

Our contributions are for academic study only and we do not endorse their use in any medical application. We are making them available to the community in order to scale out prototyping and research of these components. We are making available our designs together with STEP and Fusion360 files if others choose to take what we have done and modify, and will continually update this page.

Any included protocols are not final, pose significant risks to both patients sharing a single ventilator and do not in any way reflect the normal standard of care within the Mount Sinai Health System. Protocols have not yet been trialed in patients. They are included for academic purposes and for implementation in high-fidelity human patient simulator laboratory settings.

We are following the versioning scheme developed by the Anesthesia team, and we will update the head of this document with the most up to date versions as they become available, together with paired prototyping files and instructions. Most components developed a set of valves and adapters for printing on ordinary, widely available FDM-style 3D printers, commonly found in makerspaces, institutional prototyping facilities, and home labs. Variations and opportunities to use alternate prototyping tools, and versioned branches of the protocol, will also be tracked.
